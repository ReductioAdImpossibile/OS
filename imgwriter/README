This program creates a FAT12 disk.img for a floppy disk following the QEMU standard.
It allows the user to install it a boot0, boot1 and kernel binary.
This is not a driver. Its a program to create a img, which a driver will be based upon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
run with : ./mountfat12 --bootstage0 <file.bin> --bootstage1 <file.bin> --kernel <file.bin>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





----Parameter information:

    The resulting file will always be called disk.img.
    The bootstage0 file needs to be at least 448 Bytes big. If its bigger,
    The values of the Bytes 448 to 512 will be lost, due to the placement of the Bios Parameter Block.
    The programm appends the boot signature 0x55 0xAA by itself at the end of sector 0.

----QEMU standard / Hadware: 
    1440 KB, 512-byte sector size,

    - 80 cylinders (0 to 79)
    - 2 heads (0 to 1)
    - 18 sectors per track on one head (1 to 18)
        -> 36 sectors per cylinder distributed across two heads (seen in 3D).
        -> One ring therefore has 18 sectors, there are 80 rings, and there are two such platters.


----Partition information:

    One Dir can contain 16 Files / Dirs.
    max Filename:   8 Byte
    max File-end:   3 Byte

    IMPORTANT:
        1. This program writes the content of --bootstage0 into sector 0.
        2. This program writes the content of --bootstage1 into the file /boot/stage1      END = 'bin'
        3. This program writes the contnent of --kernel into the file /kernel/kcode         END = 'bin'
